I am Jesal. I'm a designer, educator and maker. I teach Product Design at the Somaiya School of Design, with an interest in New Media and Emergent technologies, as well as traditional craft. My current personal interest is bringing generative art into the physical realm as objects, interactions and experiences. Apart from design and making, I am a student of history, occasional poet, and sometime cyclist. My Website Previous work With a background in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design, I have worked in Lighting, Healthcare and other domains. I currently work with and teach Product Design at the Somaiya School of Design, Mumbai. I have also wandered into New Media, and am interested in Creative Coding, Physical Computing and Data Visualization. I was also an active member of the local maker community before the lockdown. \u200b At my home studio, I have a few powertools, electronics and a Prusa 3D Printer that I assembled from kit. Living in Mumbai, I have also probably spent as much time building efficient storage for \"Stuff\" as I have spent on building \"Stuff\" itself. Project : Helix Lamp I like making things for people. For a good friend's birthday, I created this helical paperfold lamp. The body/lampshade is paper, while the based is 3D printed. A bulbholder with an LED bulb are screwed into the base and the wire path goes from underneath in the gap provided.","title":"About Me"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"Hi! I am Jesal.

Something in the realm of haptics and tactile interfaces Important considerations and skillsets to include : Physical computing and IOT Generativity and Emergence DataViz ? Medical Therapy Social Impact Origami Play and Delight Exploratory, pushing the medium Art Currently I'm not interested in going into stuff like ML and AI - but that may change. I do have some interest in the ML modules that detect body poses and posture, hand gestures, etc, but from a generative art POV rather than utility and function of the gesture-control types. This is where I will start defining my final project idea and start to get use to the documentation process. Week 2 I am on a field trip to Kutch, in Western India. I am hoping to learn and document some of their craft processes, and possibly find something I can help with using the tools I have access to. Week 3 Looking at the last recitation with AI tools and other, I am questioning my earlier stand of not involving AI stuff in my project. However, I need to pull it all together and start defining what it is that I am going to execute ASAP.","title":"Project"},{"location":"project/#tactile-interface","text":"","title":"Tactile Interface"},{"location":"project/#week-1","text":"It's too early for me to exactly define what I want to make but here's a little outlining I'd rather push my boundaries than play safe, but upto a realistic point.

I spent the first few days wandering between the links and resources. Documenting the way-finding and decisions behind choosing \"How to document\" is extremely meta so I will just describe whatever I come up with post fact. Currently I am just struggling with How to create the webpages in a fast and convenient method. What have I done so far : - Attended the Wednesday session - Attended the Saturday GOT session Task 1 : Agreements Downloaded the 3 agreement documents, reuploaded them to my repo, edited them to add my name in there, moved them into a separate sub-directory for the sake of organization I would have liked to try adding them directly to my repo through some clone-shone mojo but it seemed faster to d/l and re-upload, plus I realised I wold have to edit them to sign them so files staying linked would definitely not be the solution even if that kind of thing worked. #AskAmit if this was possible Compiled all the relevant links to a Notion page, to which I will keep adding. These include my Gitlab editor page my \"deployed\" \"rendered\" page the Fab2023 schedule with all the sublinks and pages that I will go through selectively/step-by-step lots of resource, examples, and other random links tossed around during the sessions/suggested by various people The story so far : I am commfortable with markdown, I've used it before on GitHub I do not want te be editing Raw HTML (unless absloutely necessary, and even then I suspect it may not work given that static sites are probably re-generated often) MkDocs is useful to create markdown docus, I guess /shrug/ Is this correct ? #AskAmit MkDocs allows you to apply a theme, to prettify your pages. I need to find a workflow that goes Markdown -> pretty HTML, and uploads this HTML to the repo My suspicion : - edit in VSCode to make .md files - render .md files using MkDocs + applied theme to generate HTML offline on my laptop - keep syncing the folder with the repo - Gitlab will render the site as usual If this is correct, my bottlenecks/questions : - install VSCode (unless Atom is ok) - can I get away without using MkDocs and write markdown directly somewhere, like I am doing on my github sandbox site ? (I have forgotten how I do it on the sandbox site as well, and don't rememeber where I kept the notes) - but my few questions were What's the priority of index.html, index.md, readme.md, etc and other files in the same folder How do I deploy the github.io files as pages on github.com, and sub-pages, etc I had this figured out at one point so I'll just go jog my memory once I'm done with this stream-of-consciousness brain-venting+figuring out loud for now I am just creating a new folder within the assignements page and writing THIS markdown file so I can get the content down atleast, while I figure the How-To, and possibly since it's the only file in the folder, it renders as the page as well ? fingers crossed. Update 01 Things I have learnt in the past 5 minutes - refer to the markdown formatting guide, it is good to remind yourself from time to time - Folder + week01.md does not work, the file doesn't render in Gitlab - Folder + readme.md renders the readme file when you enter the folder on Gitlab More questions : I am not necessarily wedded to markdown if I can figure a good workflow that takes my content and creates HTML out of it - whether it's a WYSIWYG editor or whatever, as long as my major task is the content, and the formatting is figured maybe once, likely as a theme file. I am realising what I want is basically MS Word with Styles. Oh dear. This can be very good or very bad. Update 02 Added the link to the Week01/readme.md file to the week01.html page /Folder/file.md is RELATIVE to ROOT links, didn't work Folder/file.md is relative to current position and does work to access file Unfortunately that just gets you to download the readme.md file instead of opening it as a page Update 03 I'm making the more functional updates now, for now I guess I have explored the render + structure issues enough to poke around and #AskAmit tomorrow - Added actual name to the html files in title, heading and footer. - Updated the about.html page. PLEASE UPDATE THAT OLD COPYPASTA DESCRIPTION AND DON'T BE CAMPING AT THE INTERSECTION. That shit got old. Add images and jazz. - Added brief material to the Final Project page.
