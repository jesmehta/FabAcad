<p>Teething problems !</p>
<p>I spent the first few days wandering between the links and resources.
Documenting the way-finding and decisions behind choosing <em>"How to document"</em> is extremely meta so I will just describe whatever I come up with post fact. Currently I am just struggling with How to create the webpages in a fast and convenient method.</p>
<p>What have I done so far :
- Attended the Wednesday session
- Attended the Saturday GOT session</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 : Agreements</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloaded the 3 agreement documents,</li>
<li>reuploaded them to my repo,</li>
<li>edited them to add my name in there,</li>
<li>moved them into a separate sub-directory for the sake of organization
I would have liked to try adding them directly to my repo through some clone-shone mojo but it seemed faster to d/l and re-upload, plus I realised I wold have to edit them to sign them so files staying linked would definitely not be the solution even if that kind of thing worked. <strong>#AskAmit if this was possible</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiled all the relevant links to a Notion page, to which I will keep adding. These include</p>
<ul>
<li>my Gitlab editor page</li>
<li>my "deployed" "rendered" page</li>
<li>the Fab2023 schedule with all the sublinks and pages that I will go through selectively/step-by-step</li>
<li>lots of resource, examples, and other random links tossed around during the sessions/suggested by various people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The story so far :
I am commfortable with markdown, I've used it before on GitHub
I do not want te be editing Raw HTML (unless absloutely necessary, and even then I suspect it may not work given that static sites are probably re-generated often)</p>
<p>MkDocs is useful to create markdown docus, I guess /shrug/ Is this correct ? <strong>#AskAmit</strong>
MkDocs allows you to apply a theme, to prettify your pages.</p>
<p>I need to find a workflow that goes Markdown -&gt; pretty HTML, and uploads this HTML to the repo
My suspicion :
- edit in VSCode to make .md files
- render .md files using MkDocs + applied theme to generate HTML offline on my laptop
- keep syncing the folder with the repo
- Gitlab will render the site as usual</p>
<p>If this is correct, my bottlenecks/questions :
- install VSCode (unless Atom is ok)
- can I get away without using MkDocs and write markdown directly somewhere, like I am doing on my github sandbox site ?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(I have forgotten how I do it on the sandbox site as well, and don't rememeber where I kept the notes) - but my few questions were</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the priority of index.html, index.md, readme.md, etc and other files in the same folder</li>
<li>How do I deploy the github.io files as pages on github.com, and sub-pages, etc</li>
<li>I had this figured out at one point so I'll just go jog my memory once I'm done with this stream-of-consciousness brain-venting+figuring out loud</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>for now I am just creating a new folder within the assignements page and writing THIS markdown file so I can get the content down atleast, while I figure the How-To, and possibly since it's the only file in the folder, it renders as the page as well ? fingers crossed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="update-01">Update 01</h2>
<p>Things I have learnt in the past 5 minutes
- refer to the markdown formatting guide, it is good to remind yourself from time to time
- Folder + week01.md does not work, the file doesn't render in Gitlab
- Folder + readme.md renders the readme file when you enter the folder on Gitlab</p>
<p>More questions :
I am not necessarily wedded to markdown if I can figure a good workflow that takes my content and creates HTML out of it - whether it's a WYSIWYG editor or whatever, as long as my major task is the content, and the formatting is figured maybe once, likely as a theme file.
<em>I am realising what I want is basically MS Word with Styles. Oh dear. This can be very good or very bad.</em></p>
<h2 id="update-02">Update 02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the link to the Week01/readme.md file to the week01.html page</li>
<li>/Folder/file.md is RELATIVE to ROOT links, didn't work</li>
<li>Folder/file.md is relative to current position and does work to access file</li>
<li><strong>Unfortunately</strong> that just gets you to download the readme.md file instead of opening it as a page</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="update-03">Update 03</h2>
<p>I'm making the more functional updates now, for now I guess I have explored the render + structure issues enough to poke around and <strong>#AskAmit</strong> tomorrow
- Added actual name to the html files in title, heading and footer.
- Updated the about.html page. PLEASE UPDATE THAT OLD COPYPASTA DESCRIPTION AND DON'T BE CAMPING AT THE INTERSECTION. That shit got old. Add images and jazz.
- Added brief material to the Final Project page. Sorely missed markdown while writing pure HTML.</p></div>
