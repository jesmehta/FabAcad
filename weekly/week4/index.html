<p>Embedded programming sounds scary to me.
I have never been on good terms with electronics engineering-ish things, and the trauma that electronics subjects inflict on humble mechanical engineers through engineering school is considerable.</p>
<p>Over the past few years though, the Arduino has been a refreshing and surprisingly easy workflow to grasp.
I recognize that it a prototyping board, and it's big and chunky and expensive at times, but man! does it work simply.</p>
<p>So when Neil said that this week's session is intended to make us get past using the Arduino and making one ourselves, use the microcontrollers directly and have everything work at a fraction of the expense, I was all for it.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-chips">Choice of Chips</h2>
<p>I decided to play a little safe and work with the raw versions of MCUs that I was already familiar with as boards.</p>
<p>So my primary choice was the Atmega 320P, which is at the heart of the Arduino as well. My second familiar chip was the ESP-8266, since I had used NodeMCUs at some point in the past, and they have the benefit of built-in Wifi+BT. Neil in his talk heartily recommended the RP2040, so I added that to my list. Lastly, I was curious about the ATtiny85, which was a tiny little thing but supposed to work with the Arduino IDE as well.</p>
<p>I trawled through the net for How-Tos and other instructions and have a sizeable list of possibilities that I will continue to explore.
Once I had understood the lay of the land and figured out a few essential basics, I decided on what options I will be exploring.</p>
<p>Next I went to Robu.in, the Indian version of Radioshack or what-have-you to see what they had in stock and what they said about it, to get a reality check on what's available and prices. I also followed that up with calls and a trip to Lamington road, the street market for all things electronic in Bombay.</p>
<p>These are the few directions I want to really explore :
1. Using the Atmega328P</p>
